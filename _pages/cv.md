Work experience
======
* Jan 2024 - Present: **Clinical Data Scientist| Centre for Human Drug Research**
  * Created novel digital biomarkers for neurologic and psychiatric pathologies based on machine learning and deep learning techniques.
  * Conducted Clinical validation of biomarkers for use in pharmacological interventions

* Jan 2023 - Dec 2023: **Algorithm Developer | perClass**
  * Introduced new features to perClass Mira software for 3D (hyperspectral) data processing - calibration, noise reduction, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction.}
  * Analysed the feasibility of spectral unmixing, regression algorithms for post harvest food quality parameters for NIR and VNIR spectral ranges - Brix, firmness, weight, protein content.}
  * Created libraries for functions tailored to workflows, ensuring performance consistency on multiple datasets.
  * Conducted literature reviews for spectral processing algorithms for various applications

* Apr 2022 - Oct 2023: **Computer Vision Engineer | Team Tumbleweed**
  * Conducted a comprehensive literature review to gather relevant information and identify state-of-the-art techniques in odometry and related fields.
  * Developed and implemented odometry algorithms using advanced techniques such as dynamic state estimation and Bayesian processing.
  * Engaged in requirement engineering and stakeholder discussions to understand project goals and constraints.
  * Supported systems engineering design tradeoff activities by collaborating with cross-functional teams to identify tradeoffs and make informed decisions regarding system design.

* Dec 2020 - Mar 2022: **Deep Learning Researcher | CWI**
  * Performed a literature review of state-of-the-art feature engineering and processing techniques
  for speech and physiological signals.
  * Created Multimodal Physiology-reinforced Siamese Network, a novel unsupervised learning algorithm to address challenges and constraints of emotion/sentiment classiﬁcation from real-world speech for voice assistants (Few Shot Learning)
  * Improved state-of-the-art emotion recognition benchmarks by a margin of 8-12%.
  * Enhanced model performance for robustness against background noise from real-world within
  2-5% margins of baseline.

* May 2016 - August 2019: **System Engineer/Data Scientist | Siemens Mobility, India**
  * Contributed to Software and Hardware Design, Modelling and for Computer Vision based Broken
Rail & Intrusion Detection System for Indian Railways
  * Curated and managed the ﬁrst dataset for rail anomalies obtained from sensing experiments in
Indian railways, Benchmarked the severity of rail cracks based on several feature sets.
 * Tailored computer vision-based anomaly detection pipeline’s architecture to increase sensitivity
towards artefacts from Indian setting
