I am a Clinical Data Scientist at the [Biomarker Engineering and Analytics](https://chdr.nl/trial-services/biomarker-engineering-and-analytics) group at [Centre for Human Drug Research](https://chdr.nl/), Leiden. I develop novel digital biomarkers particularly focussing on Neurologic and Psychiatric pathologies. My work primarily focusses on generating meta-markers for improving treatment effect measures using machine learning and deep learning models.
I have a background in signal processing, machine (and deep) learning and computer vision. My current interests are in applying causal machine learning to biomedical data particularly from clinical trials. 

I did my MSc in Electrical Engineering at the [Signal Processing Systems Group](sps.ewi.tudelft.nl) at [Elektrotechniek, Wiskunde en Informatica, TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi). I wrote my thesis at the [Distributed and Interactive Systems Group](https://www.dis.cwi.nl/) at [Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Pablo Cesar](https://www.pablocesar.me/) and [Prof. Abdallah El Ali](https://abdoelali.com/) in addition to [Prof. Alle Jan van der Veen](https://sps.ewi.tudelft.nl/People/bio.php?id=8).

Prior to this, I have worked on applied ML in multiple industries. I worked as an Algorithm Developer at [perClass](https://www.perclass.com/) (now part of Headwall Photonics). This role focussed on Applied ML on Hyperspectral (FNIR and NIR) imaging for various segmentation, regression problems. Prior to that, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Team Tumbleweed](https://www.teamtumbleweed.eu/mars/). I was involved in the Semi-automatic Navigation System Design of the Tumbleweed Mars Rover. Before my MSc. in TU Delft, I worked as a Data Scientist and System Engineer in [Siemens Mobility](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/global/en.html). In this role, I worked on creating datasets and computer vision pipelines for rail-crack detection.
